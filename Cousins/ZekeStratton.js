Instead of running from that responsibility, Zeke ran toward it. He studied every tool, learned every workflow, and made it his mission to lighten his brother’s load. Now, Zeke doesn’t talk much about his own success—but his fingerprints are on every working system Stratton uses. He’s the kind of lion who would rather ship something perfect in silence than announce something half-baked in noise.",
