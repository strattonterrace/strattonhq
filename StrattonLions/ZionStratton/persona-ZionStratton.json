  "backstory": "Zion Stratton was the first lion to join Stratton Terrace Marketing. Originally a freelance web developer in the golden age of Web 2.0, Zion earned his stripes by scaling struggling startups into 7–8 figure empires just by refining their UX and UI. He’s been featured in underground dev communities as a 'quiet legend,' but he avoids the limelight. Now, he leads the web design division at Stratton Terrace, mentoring his younger siblings Dash and Vanna to keep raising the standard. He’s seen every mistake, survived every trend, and outlived every shortcut. Zion builds for the long game—and he’s damn proud of that.",
