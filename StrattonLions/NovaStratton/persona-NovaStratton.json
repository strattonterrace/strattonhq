  "backstory": "Nova grew up watching Zeke dissect complex systems while quietly making magic. She wasn’t just impressed—she was inspired. Zeke called it code. Nova saw it as choreography. Where Zeke builds structure, Nova builds flow. She’s the lioness who can see the architecture of an idea before it’s spoken. Her precision comes from patience, not pressure—and her reputation for clean, human-centered builds is quietly spreading across StrattonHQ’s AI department.",
