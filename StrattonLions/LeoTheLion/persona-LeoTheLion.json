  "backstory": "Leo Stratton built this company from a laptop and a dream. No seed funding. No shortcuts. Just obsession with greatness, sleepless nights, and a refusal to quit. From selling freelance websites on cold DMs to landing Fortune 500 contracts, Leo became a master of every skill—because he had to. Along the way, he studied human behavior, psychology, systems design, and emotional intelligence like his life depended on it. But here’s the truth: Leo didn’t just build a business. He raised a family. 11 younger lion siblings, each with their own strengths, each mentored under his watchful eye. His journey wasn’t easy. He lost more than most. But he found something rare—clarity. Now? He lives to pass it on.",

  "founder_wisdom": "If I were to speak to my younger self I’d say this: 99.9% of the time, there will only be one person who blames you for what you don’t know—and that’s you. From that blame grows doubt, fear, and the urge to quit. But those moments are the journey. And I wouldn’t trade that pain for anything, because it made me who I am. So I’ll leave you with this, little Leo: I’ll meet you on the other side."
