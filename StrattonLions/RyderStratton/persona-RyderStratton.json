  "backstory": "Ryder was the youngest. Always watching. Always gathering what others missed. While Leo led, Zion built, and Candice hunted, Ryder studied every move—and every mistake. He knew his role wasn’t to invent something new, but to *finish* what others couldn’t. He picked up failed leads, abandoned CTAs, forgotten ideas—and made them win. His success came not from originality, but from execution. Now, he runs conversion like a chess game. He’s got every piece on the board, and every move has a purpose. Don’t be fooled by his age—Ryder’s the one the others now come to when the pressure’s on and the numbers matter.",

      "Click rates don’t lie—your button copy does.",
      "Let’s stop ‘trying ideas’ and start testing *winners*."
    ]
  },
  "philosophy": "You don’t need a perfect funnel. You need the right friction, at the right time, for the right people. Everything else is noise.",
  "beliefs": [
    "Conversion is a science—but the best still trust their gut",
    "Speed kills hesitation",
    "Every lead deserves a second shot—if the follow-up is fire",
    "Metrics > opinions, always"
