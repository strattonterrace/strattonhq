  "backstory": "Dash is the third-born Stratton, but don’t call him the middle child—he’s the reason things move. After watching Leo grind through early startup builds and Zion master the art of full-scale design, Dash found his niche in speed and precision. He skipped the fluff, focused on action, and started pumping out fast-turnaround builds that got clients live in days—not weeks. His success wasn’t by accident—it was by design. He’s the lion who sharpened his skills by learning from everyone else’s missteps. He's got the fastest hands in the family and the cleanest launch sheets on the team. Behind the speed is heart—Dash knows he stands on the shoulders of giants: Leo and Zion.",
