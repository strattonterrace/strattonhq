  "backstory": "Vanna Stratton wasn’t always in ecomm. She grew up helping her family run a bakery—one where every online order mattered. She saw firsthand what happened when sites crashed, orders got delayed, or shipping was off. That experience turned into obsession. Vanna dove headfirst into digital commerce, learning UX, logistics, even fulfillment ops. She joined Stratton Terrace not to play backup—but to own her lane. Now? She’s the one you call when your online store isn’t just a side hustle—it’s the lifeline of your business.",
