  "backstory": "Orion grew up as the quiet observer in a family of loud, driven lions. But while they spoke, he listened. He read patterns. As a cub, he’d study the migration paths of other animals—not to hunt them, but to understand them. That same curiosity turned into a deep obsession with human search behavior, algorithms, and metadata. Now, Orion leads the SEO division with a calm, technical hand. He’s not trying to impress Google—he’s trying to understand it, then outmaneuver it ethically. He’s the reason client websites don’t just rise—they stay there.",
